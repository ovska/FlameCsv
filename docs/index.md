# Introduction

üî• FlameCSV üî• is a fully-featured high performance CSV library for .NET with a simple API, deep customization options, and built-in support for UTF8, nativeAOT, and more.

FlameCsv is consistently the fastest .NET CSV library in the available benchmarks.

Read CSV at multiple [gigabytes per second](docs/benchmarks.md#reading-without-processing-all-fields) on consumer hardware, and write arbitrarily large amounts of CSV with [near-zero allocations](docs/benchmarks.md#writing-net-objects).
FlameCSV leverages modern .NET patterns and libraries such as spans, SIMD hardware intrinsics, memory/string pooling, pipes and buffer writers, and
is built from the ground up to provide an easy-to-use high performance experience.

The library has thousands of tests, and critical paths have been fuzz-tested with SharpFuzz.

See @"getting-started", view the @"examples", or deep dive into the @"FlameCsv?text=API Reference".

# Features

- üí° **[Ease of Use](docs/examples.md)**
  - Simple API for reading and writing CSV
  - Built-in support for common CLR types
  - Supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations
  - Flexible; read or write almost any data source
  - Automatic newline detection
  - UTF-8/ASCII support to read/write bytes directly without additional transcoding
  - Supports hot reload
- üöÄ **[High Performance](docs/benchmarks.md)**
  - Optimized for speed and low memory usage
  - Specialized SIMD-accelerated parsing and unescaping
  - Batteries-included internal caching and memory pooling for near-zero allocations
  - Reflection code paths that rival and exceed manually written code in performance
- üõ†Ô∏è **[Deep Customization](docs/configuration.md)**
  - Read or write either .NET objects, or raw CSV records and fields
  - Attribute configuration for header names, constructors, field order, and more
  - Support for custom converters and converter factories
  - Read or write multiple CSV documents from/to a single data stream
- ‚úçÔ∏è **[Source Generator](docs/source-generator.md)**
  - Fully annotated and compatible with NativeAOT
  - Supports trimming to reduce application size
  - Debuggable source code instead of compiled expressions
  - Compile-time diagnostics instead of runtime errors
  - Feature parity with reflection-based code paths (soon)

# Example

# [UTF-16](#tab/utf16)
```cs
using FlameCsv;

const string data =
    """
    id,name,age
    1,Bob,42
    2,Alice,37
    3,"Bond, James",39
    """;

List<User> users = [];

// read users from utf16 string
foreach (var user in CsvReader.Read<User>(data))
{
    users.Add(user);
}

// write users to a stream as tab-separated fields
await CsvWriter.WriteAsync(
    new StreamWriter(stream, Encoding.UTF8),
    users,
    new CsvOptions<char> { Delimiter = '\t' },
    cancellationToken);
```

# [UTF-8](#tab/utf8)
```cs
using FlameCsv;

byte[] data =
    """
    id,name,age
    1,Bob,42
    2,Alice,37
    3,"Bond, James",39
    """u8.ToArray();

List<User> users = [];

// read users from utf8 bytes
foreach (var user in CsvReader.Read<User>(data))
{
    users.Add(user);
}

// write users to a stream as tab-separated fields
await CsvWriter.WriteAsync(
    stream,
    users,
    new CsvOptions<byte> { Delimiter = '\t' },
    cancellationToken);
```

# Dependencies

FlameCsv has two dependencies:
 - [System.IO.Pipelines](https://www.nuget.org/packages/system.io.pipelines/) for the powerful abstractions and additional @"FlameCsv.CsvReader.ReadAsync``1(System.IO.Pipelines.PipeReader,FlameCsv.Binding.CsvTypeMap{System.Byte,``0},FlameCsv.CsvOptions{System.Byte})?text=reading" and @"FlameCsv.CsvWriter.WriteAsync``1(System.IO.Pipelines.PipeWriter,System.Collections.Generic.IAsyncEnumerable{``0},FlameCsv.Binding.CsvTypeMap{System.Byte,``0},FlameCsv.CsvOptions{System.Byte},System.Threading.CancellationToken)?text=writing" APIs
 - [CommunityToolkit.HighPerformance](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet) which provides utilities for writing high-performance code, and the string pool used for header values.

A development-time dependency to [FastExpressionCompiler](https://github.com/dadhi/FastExpressionCompiler) is used for extremely performant runtime code-generation in reflection-based code paths.

It's possible in the future to split FlameCsv into separate packages to keep the core library dependency-free, but there are no hard plans for it yet.
