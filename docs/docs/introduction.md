# Introduction

FlameCSV is a high-performance C# library for reading and writing CSV data.
It has a low barrier of entry, and deep customization options if needed.

Full native AOT and trimming support is available with a source generator,
or a reflection based type binding that rivals the source generator
in performance thanks to caching and the excellent
[FastExpressionCompiler](https://github.com/dadhi/FastExpressionCompiler) libary.
